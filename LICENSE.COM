Version 1.0 – January 2025

This licence grants the Licensee the right to use ThreadCommissionerKit in
commercial, proprietary, or closed-source software, subject to payment of the
applicable fee and acceptance of these terms.

## 1. Scope of Licence

- A paid licence is required for any application, product, or service used in a
  commercial context, distributed to paying customers, or developed on behalf of
  a company or client.
- The licence permits internal use, bundling the binary or source into closed
  source products, and modifying the code for use within licensed products.
- Each licence covers a single organisation (and its wholly-owned subsidiaries)
  and the number of products agreed in writing.

## 2. Distribution Conditions

- Redistribution of the library (modified or unmodified) is allowed only within
  the scope of a valid commercial licence.
- You may not publicly post or sub-license the source code or prebuilt binaries,
  except as required to ship compiled applications that incorporate the library.
- You must retain copyright notices and include a copy of this licence in your
  product documentation or legal notices.

## 3. Term and Termination

- The licence becomes effective once fees are paid (if applicable) and the
  licence confirmation is issued.
- The licence continues until terminated. It will terminate automatically if you
  breach these terms, fail to pay fees, or use the library outside the permitted
  scope.
- Upon termination you must cease using the library and remove it from your
  products. Termination does not require refund of fees already paid.

## 4. Warranty and Liability

- The library is provided “as-is” without warranties of any kind, express or
  implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
  non-infringement.
- Liability of the licensor is limited to the amount paid for the licence. The
  licensor shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
  damages.
